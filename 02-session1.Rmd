# Session 1: Build a simple website with Distill

## To do before the workshop {#s1pre}

-   <input type="checkbox" unchecked></input> Complete all the steps in the [prerequisites](#prereqs) section.

-   <input type="checkbox" unchecked></input> Decide if you want to buy a [domain name (see appendix)](#domain). Buying a domain name is __totally optional__, and you don't have to decide now. But, if you know you want to, you might as well get set up now.

-   <input type="checkbox" unchecked></input> Decide what links to external things you want to share on your website. Have them easily accessible to copy and paste. _GitHub? LinkedIn? Twitter?_

-   <input type="checkbox" unchecked></input> Choose a profile picture for your website. A headshot with a simple background is best. If you don't have one/don't want to show a photo, you may want to find some other form of an avatar or placeholder picture. Have the PNG or JPEG easily available to copy to the file you'll need.

-   <input type="checkbox" unchecked></input> [Download the R Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf) and pay special attention to the '__Pandocâ€™s Markdown__' section on the lefthand side of the second page. 

-   <input type="checkbox" unchecked></input> Install the below R packages. I.e., copy and paste the below code into your R console and run it. If you're not sure what this means or how to do it, come talk to use during a TidyTuesday and Talk session (Tuesdays, from 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. ET, on Zoom, see the [Events list](https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtSci-STA/ISSC/_layouts/15/Events.aspx?ListGuid=0679786c-8a7e-483c-9ec5-3845602a70e5))

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('postcards')
install.packages('distill')
```

## Workshop instructions

### Landing page with `postcards`

Let's start with the most basic thing we can do, create a landing page with a brief bio and some key links. It is a bit like a business card for the digital age.

This page can later become the home page of your website, or you might find you want to do something more customized.

1.  Make sure you have [installed packages you needed to.](#s1pre)

2.  Create a new R project using the postcard template:
    a. 'File -\> New Project -\> New Directory -\> Postcards Website.'. 
    b. Choose a sensible location for this project to live on your computer.
    c. Pick a theme, I'd recommend trying 'trestles' for now, but you can see all the different 'looks' [here (scroll down)](https://github.com/seankross/postcards).
    d. Choose 'Open in new session', just to be safe. 

3. Run this code in your console: `file.create('.nojekyll')`. It tell GitHub something important about how _not_ to build the site.

4. Navigate to the __Build__ tab in the environment pane (usually the top right pane in your R Studio if you haven't customized the layout) and click __Build Website__. This should create a pop-up that allows you to preview what the basic template builds.

#### Example

I made the ISSC a landing page. You can view it at https://uoft-doss-issc.github.io/ and the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/UofT-DoSS-ISSC/UofT-DoSS-ISSC.github.io). 

### Multipage site


## Other tips

- Add `.DS_Store` to your `.gitignore` file (if you're on a Mac)

## Setting up a custom domain

It can take a while (like, a day or so) to update the redirection between your GitHub page and your domain, so be prepared to be patient! 

These instructions are quite good:
