# Session 1: Build a simple website with Distill

## To do before the workshop {#s1pre}

-   <input type="checkbox" unchecked></input> Complete all the steps in the [prerequisites](#prereqs) section.

-   <input type="checkbox" unchecked></input> Decide if you want to buy a [domain name (see appendix)](#domain). Buying a domain name is **totally optional**, and you don't have to decide now. But, if you know you want to, you might as well get set up now.

-   <input type="checkbox" unchecked></input> Decide what links to external things you want to share on your website. Have them easily accessible to copy and paste. *GitHub? LinkedIn? Twitter?*

-   <input type="checkbox" unchecked></input> Choose a profile picture for your website. A headshot with a simple background is best. If you don't have one/don't want to show a photo, you may want to find some other form of an avatar or placeholder picture. Have the PNG or JPEG easily available to copy to the file you'll need.

-   <input type="checkbox" unchecked></input> [Download the R Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf) and pay special attention to the '**Pandoc's Markdown**' section on the lefthand side of the second page.

-   <input type="checkbox" unchecked></input> Install the below R packages. I.e., copy and paste the below code into your R console and run it. If you're not sure what this means or how to do it, come talk to use during a TidyTuesday and Talk session (Tuesdays, from 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. ET, on Zoom, see the [Events list](https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtSci-STA/ISSC/_layouts/15/Events.aspx?ListGuid=0679786c-8a7e-483c-9ec5-3845602a70e5))

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('postcards') # for landing page
install.packages('distill') # for multipage site
install.packages('usethis') # for easy connection to Git and GitHub
```

### Thank you, Rohan!

## Workshop instructions

### Landing page with `postcards`

Let's start with the most basic thing we can do, create a landing page with a brief bio and some key links. It is a bit like a business card for the digital age.

This page can later become the home page of your website, or you might find you want to do something more customized.

1.  Make sure you have [installed packages you needed to.](#s1pre)

2.  Create a new R project using the postcard template:

    a.  'File -\> New Project -\> New Directory -\> Postcards Website.'.
    b.  Choose a sensible location for this project to live on your computer. I'd recommend just calling this something like 'task1'.
    c.  Pick a theme, I'd recommend trying 'trestles' for now, but you can see all the different 'looks' [here (scroll down)](https://github.com/seankross/postcards).
    d.  Choose 'Open in new session', just to be safe.

3.  Run `file.create('.nojekyll')` in your console. It will later tell GitHub something about how *not* to build your site.

4.  Open the 'index.Rmd' file and Knit it to View what it looks like. 

5. 

6.  Set up Git and a GitHub repo. Commit and push. There are quite a few ways to do this (see [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html) to GitHub with the help of the `usethis` package.

    a.  In your console, run `usethis::use_git()` .

        1.  You'll be asked if it is okay to commit your uncommitted files. Read the options and enter the number for 'Yes'.

        2.  You'll then be asked about restarting so the Git panel can be available. Choose to restart.

    b.  If you configured your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) (see Chapter 10 of Happy Git with R: Cache credentials for HTTPS) you can run `usethis::use_github()` in your console to set up and push to a repo of the same name as the folder you set up (e.g. 'task1'). You'll be able to delete this later once your website has taken it's final form.
    
       1.  GitHub should open in your browser. If not, navigate to your GitHub repo for the site and go Settings (top horizontal menu)  and then Pages (vertical menus on left)
       2.  Under source, change from None to master (or main if that is what your branch is called) and change /(root) to /docs and click save.
       
6.  Make a change and repush to GitHub using the terminal tab!

```
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "push me and then just touch me (this song came outbefore some of you were born)"
git push
```
       

#### Example

I made the ISSC a landing page. You can view it at <https://uoft-doss-issc.github.io/> and the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/UofT-DoSS-ISSC/UofT-DoSS-ISSC.github.io).

### Multipage site

1.  Make sure you have [installed packages you needed to.](#s1pre)

2.  Create a new R project using the postcard template:

    a.  'File -\> New Project -\> New Directory -\> Distill Website.'.
    b.  Choose a sensible location for this project to live on your computer. I'd recommend just calling this something like 'task2' for now.
    c.  Tick 'Configure for GitHub pages'.
    d.  Choose 'Open in new session', just to be safe.
    

4.  Navigate to the **Build** tab in the environment pane (usually the top right pane in your R Studio if you haven't customized the layout) and click **Build Website**. This should create a pop-up that allows you to preview what the basic template builds.

## Other tips

-   Add `.DS_Store` to your `.gitignore` file (if you're on a Mac)
-   This blog post from the RStudio team is a great feature summary for the `distill` package: <https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/12/07/distill/>.

## Setting up a custom domain

It can take a while (like, a day or so) to update the redirection between your GitHub page and your domain, so be prepared to be patient!

These instructions are quite good: <https://richpauloo.github.io/2019-11-17-Linking-a-Custom-Domain-to-Github-Pages/>
