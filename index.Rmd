# Introduction

There are many, many ways to make a website these days. This workshop series aims to help you make a personal website using the [`distill` package](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/).This is just ONE way that is used by a lots of folks in statistics and that leverages your existing R and R Markdown skills. It is reasonably beginner friendly and creates a professional looking website.

Note: If you already have a personal website, sessions 2 and/or 3 may still be of interest to you. You can attend as many or as few of these sessions as you would like.

## What we're going to do during the workshop series

- Get set up with R/RStudio/Git and GitHub (if not already)
- Build a basic landing page website with `postcards`
- Create a multi-paged paged website with `distill`
- Begin to develop an aesthetic for your "'personal brand' ^[Do we hate the concept of 'personal brand'? I think there is some value in thinking about how we make it easier for the world to understand us...but there is so much grossness with it too...]
- Learn some basic ways to edit the look and feel of a site with CSS
- Set up and post a first blog post
- Develop and polish professional content for your website and blog
- Connect to additional U of T resources that can help you develop your professional digital presence (TBC)
