# Buy a domain name (optional) {#domain}

You __do not have to buy anything__ to build and host a professional personal website as a student. BUT, if you've always wanted to own www.firstnamelastname.com, here are some instructions. Note, if you're not sure what a domain name is there are heaps of explainer articles online, just search "what is a domain name". You don't really need to know too much.

### Some caveats

- I'd recommend doing some of your own further research to make sure this is actually the best approach for you and what you actually want or need.
- This isn't legal or financial advice. Duh. 


### Don't pay full price! 

There is almost always a deal going on. May not still be live when you're looking, but 'nameboy' was a code for 25% of domains.com when I was setting up mine.

## But what if you don't buy a domain name?

If you don't want to buy a domain name, your personal website's address will appear as: `your-github-username.github.io`. Even more reason to choose a good username! See more in the [prerequisite secion](#prereqs).

For example, I made a simple landing page for the ISSC at https://uoft-doss-issc.github.io/.
